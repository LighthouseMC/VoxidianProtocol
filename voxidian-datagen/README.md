# voxidian-datagen
Voxidian-Datagen grabs it's files from the `/datagen/` folder.
This binary will only be used for development purposes when updating the library.
This crate should not be published to `crates.io`, as it is development-specific.

# Code Generation
The `/datagen/` folder should be at the root of the project. 

It should contain two directories generated by Minecraft Server:
- `/datagen/data/` - The datapack for vanilla minecraft
- `/datagen/reports/` - The reports for non-datapack registries of vanilla minecraft

Using these files, this crate, when ran using `cargo run` as the working directory as `/voxidian-datagen/`
will generate the source code files in the needed directories.
